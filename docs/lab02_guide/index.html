        <p>In addition to medical care, the hospital is heavily involved in research and innovation. Doctors and
            researchers from the Faculty of Medicine frequently conduct studies that contribute to Thailand’s medical
            advancements, such as new treatment approaches, public health solutions, and disease prevention strategies.
            These research activities help ensure that the hospital remains a leader in modern medicine, offering
            patients the most updated and effective care possible.
            <br><br><br>
            Beyond its clinical and academic roles, Srinagarind Hospital is also designed to support patients and
            families during challenging times. The campus includes waiting areas, food stalls, convenience stores, and
            green spaces to make long hospital visits more manageable. Many volunteers and staff members work to create
            a warm, supportive atmosphere, helping patients feel more comfortable and cared for. Altogether, Srinagarind
            Hospital stands as a center of healing, learning, and community support within Khon Kaen University.
